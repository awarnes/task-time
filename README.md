# Task Time

This is a task timing app to help keep track of time spent working on specific tasks. The main goal is to make it as easy and seamless as possible to track time spent on individual tasks.

Users will sign in and create list of common activities/tasks to track.
When users want to time a task they'll click the labeled button which will start a timer.
When users want to stop tracking an task, they can click another task, click the same task, or click the stop button.
Each time a task is stopped, the information will be stored in firebase in a simple data structure for that user.

The reports section will allow a user to query by task and by time to see which tasks they've worked on and when.
